## Image Description

A "New Game" button for a factory/automation game loading menu. The button should be:

**Dimensions:** 600x120 pixels (will be scaled down to 300x60 in-game at 2x scale)

**Style:**
- Modern, industrial/factory theme matching a sci-fi automation game
- Dark UI aesthetic with subtle glow effects
- Professional and polished appearance
- Clear, readable "New Game" text

**Visual Design:**
- Background: Dark green (#2C4A2C) with slight gradient from darker to slightly lighter
- Border: Medium green (#3D5F3D) with subtle inner highlight
- Text: Bold white or light green text saying "NEW GAME" in a modern sans-serif font (centered)
- Optional decorative elements: Subtle mechanical/industrial accents in corners (gears, circuits, or factory icons) - keep them minimal and not distracting
- Optional glow effect: Slight outer glow around the button edges (soft green/white) to make it feel interactive and polished
- 3D effect: Subtle beveled/raised appearance with highlight on top edge and shadow on bottom edge

**Mood:** Inviting, professional, game menu UI, ready to start a new adventure

**Technical Notes:**

- Transparent background (PNG)
- High contrast text for readability
- Colors should work well against dark UI backgrounds
