 # FactoryForge Research Guide

## Overview

Research is the key to unlocking advanced buildings, recipes, and bonuses in FactoryForge. By researching technologies, you'll gain access to more efficient machines, better logistics, and powerful upgrades.

## How to Access Research

1. **Open the Research Menu**: Press the **lab icon** (⚗️) in the bottom toolbar (third button from the left)
2. **View Available Technologies**: Technologies are organized in a 3-tier grid
3. **Select Technology**: Tap on any available technology to start researching it

## How Research Works

### Science Packs
Research requires **science packs** - special items produced in labs that represent scientific knowledge:

- **Automation Science Pack (Red)**: Basic research pack, crafted from iron plates and copper cables
- **Logistic Science Pack (Green)**: Advanced research pack, requires automation science packs to unlock

### Research Process

1. **Choose a Technology**: Select any technology that meets the prerequisites
2. **Provide Science Packs**: The technology's cost in science packs is shown
3. **Fill Labs with Science Packs**: Put science packs into lab inventories for research to progress
4. **Wait for Completion**: Research takes time based on the technology's complexity
5. **Collect Results**: Once complete, the technology unlocks new recipes and bonuses

### Research Time
- Technologies take varying amounts of time to research
- Research speed can be increased with research speed bonuses
- You can only research one technology at a time

### Using Labs for Research

**Labs are the heart of your research operation!** Here's how to use them:

1. **Build Labs**: Craft and place lab buildings (requires automation science packs to unlock)
2. **Power Labs**: Labs need electricity to function - connect them to power poles
3. **Fill with Science Packs**: Double-tap on a lab to open its inventory, then transfer science packs from your inventory to the lab
4. **Monitor Progress**: Research progress is shown in the Research menu as a percentage
5. **Multiple Labs**: Build multiple labs and fill them all with science packs to speed up research

**Important**: Science packs must be in lab inventories, not just in your player inventory!

- Advanced technologies often require their basic counterparts
- Some technologies form chains (e.g., Solar Energy → Electric Energy Accumulators)

## Research Queue

FactoryForge currently supports researching one technology at a time. Future updates may add research queues for multiple simultaneous research projects.

## Tips for Success

1. **Maintain Science Production**: Always have labs producing science packs
2. **Plan Ahead**: Research prerequisite technologies before advanced ones
3. **Balance Research**: Don't neglect production while researching
4. **Use Bonuses**: Research speed and mining productivity early for compounding benefits
5. **Defend Your Base**: Research military technologies to protect against threats

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Research a Technology?
- Check prerequisites in the technology description
- Ensure you have enough science packs
- Make sure no other technology is currently being researched

### Research Not Progressing?
- Verify labs are powered and have science packs
- Check that inserters are supplying science packs to labs
- Ensure you have enough labs for the required science pack production

### No Technologies Available?
- You may have researched everything currently available
- Check for new technologies that require recently completed prerequisites
