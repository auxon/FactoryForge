# FactoryForge Quickstart Guide

## Game Goal
Produce rockets with satellites in orbit to achieve victory. This requires building a complete factory automation complex from scratch.

## Phase 1: Basic Setup (0-10 minutes)

### 1. Start Mining Resources
- Place **Burner Mining Drills** on iron ore and copper ore deposits
- Use wood or coal as fuel (wood from trees, coal from coal deposits)
- Build **Stone Furnaces** to smelt ore into plates

**Critical Early Items:**
- Iron plates (for tools and basic machines)
- Copper plates (for cables and circuits)
- Iron gear wheels (for machines)
- Copper cables (for power)

### 2. Set Up Power
- Build **Water Pumps** near water sources to extract water
- Build **Pipes** to connect water from pumps to **Boilers**
- Build **Boilers** and connect them to water pipes
- Connect **Steam Engines** to boilers (they consume steam and produce electricity)
- Use coal as fuel for boilers
- Connect everything with **Small Electric Poles**
- **Note**: Boilers require constant water supply - without water pumps and pipes, your power plant won't work!

### 3. Begin Automation
- Replace burner miners with **Electric Mining Drills**
- Build **Assembling Machine 1** for crafting components
- Create **Transport Belts** to move items between machines
- **Inserters** are CRITICAL - they automatically move items between machines and belts
- Place inserters to:
  - Load raw materials into furnaces/assemblers
  - Unload finished products onto belts
  - Move items between different belt lines
- Without inserters, your factory won't run automatically!

## Phase 2: Science Research (10-30 minutes)

### Automation Science Packs
- Craft: 1 Copper plate + 1 Iron gear wheel → 5 packs
- Enables basic machine upgrades

### Logistic Science Packs
- Craft: 1 Inserter + 1 Transport Belt → 5 packs
- Unlocks advanced belts and inserters

**Upgrade your factory:**
- **Fast Transport Belts** (30 items/second) - faster item throughput
- **Long-handed Inserters** - reach farther to connect machines
- **Fast Inserters** - grab/place items 2.3x faster
- **Steel Furnaces** (2x faster smelting)
- **Assembling Machine 2** (1.25x faster crafting)
- **Inserter Strategy**: Use long-handed inserters for spacing, fast inserters for high-volume production lines

## Phase 3: Oil Processing (30-60 minutes)

### Set Up Oil Infrastructure
1. Build **Pumpjack** on oil deposits
2. Build **Oil Refinery** for **Advanced Oil Processing**
3. Build **Chemical Plant** for fluid processing
4. Build **Water Pump** near water for water supply (needed for oil processing AND boiler power)

### Key Products from Oil
- **Plastic Bars** (from petroleum gas + coal)
- **Sulfuric Acid** (enables batteries and processing units)
- **Solid Fuel** (better than coal for power)

### Chemical Science Packs
- Craft: 3 Advanced Circuits + 2 Engine Units + 1 Sulfuric Acid
- Unlocks advanced technologies

## Phase 4: Advanced Materials (60-90 minutes)

### Steel Production
- Convert iron plates to steel in steel furnaces
- Steel enables: Electric Furnaces, Advanced Circuits, Nuclear tech

### Circuit Production
- **Electronic Circuits** → **Advanced Circuits** → **Processing Units**
- Processing Units are needed for rocket components

### Nuclear Infrastructure
- Mine uranium ore
- Build **Centrifuge** for uranium processing
- Build **Nuclear Reactor** for massive power generation

## Phase 5: Rocket Production (90+ minutes)

### Rocket Components
1. **Rocket Fuel** (10 solid fuel → 1 rocket fuel)
2. **Low Density Structure** (steel + copper + plastic)
3. **Rocket Parts** (steel + structures + fuel + circuits)

### Satellite Assembly
- **Satellite** requires:
  - 100 Low Density Structures
  - 100 Solar Panels
  - 100 Accumulators
  - 5 Radars
  - 100 Processing Units
  - 50 Rocket Fuel

### Rocket Silo Construction
- Massive structure requiring 1000 steel plates, 1000 stone bricks, 100 pipes, 200 processing units
- Launches satellites into orbit
- Each launch generates Space Science Packs

## Victory Conditions
- Launch satellites into orbit using the Rocket Silo
- Space Science Packs are generated automatically from successful launches
- Accumulate enough space science to complete the final research

## Tips for Speed
1. **Parallel Production**: Set up multiple production lines for key materials
2. **Inserter Mastery**: Always use inserters to automate material flow - they're your factory's "workers"
3. **Belt Optimization**: Use splitters and mergers for efficient item distribution
4. **Inserter Upgrades**: Stack inserters handle multiple items at once, fast inserters for speed
5. **Power Scaling**: Transition from steam to solar/nuclear as you expand
6. **Water Management**: Never forget water pumps - boilers and oil processing both need constant water

## Critical Path Summary
**Iron Plates** → **Copper Cables** → **Electric Circuits** → **Inserters/Belts** → **Oil Processing** → **Advanced Circuits** → **Processing Units** → **Rocket Components** → **Satellite Launch**
