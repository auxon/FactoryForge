# FactoryForge Quickstart Guide

## Game Goal
Produce rockets with satellites in orbit to achieve victory. This requires building a complete factory automation complex from scratch.

## Phase 1: Basic Setup (0-10 minutes)

### 1. Start Mining Resources
- Place **Burner Mining Drills** on iron ore and copper ore deposits
- Use wood or coal as fuel (wood from trees, coal from coal deposits)
- Build **Stone Furnaces** to smelt ore into plates

**Critical Early Items:**
- Iron plates (for tools and basic machines)
- Copper plates (for cables and circuits)
- Iron gear wheels (for machines)
- Copper cables (for power)

### 2. Set Up Power
- Build **Water Pumps** near water sources to extract water
- Build **Pipes** to connect water from pumps to **Boilers**
- Build **Boilers** and connect them to water pipes
- Connect **Steam Engines** to boilers (they consume steam and produce electricity)
- Use coal as fuel for boilers
- Connect everything with **Small Electric Poles**
- **Note**: Boilers require constant water supply - without water pumps and pipes, your power plant won't work!

### 3. Begin Automation
- Replace burner miners with **Electric Mining Drills**
- Build **Assembling Machine 1** for crafting components
- Create **Transport Belts** to move items between machines
- **Inserters** are CRITICAL - they automatically move items between machines and belts
- Place inserters to:
  - Load raw materials into furnaces/assemblers
  - Unload finished products onto belts
  - Move items between different belt lines
- Without inserters, your factory won't run automatically!

## Phase 2: Science Research (10-30 minutes)

### Research System Overview
- Build **Labs** to process science packs and unlock technologies
- Labs require **60 kW power** and consume science packs continuously
- Research unlocks new recipes, buildings, and technologies
- **Without research, you cannot progress!** Build labs early and keep them supplied with science packs.

### Lab Construction
- **Lab** requires: 10 Electronic Circuits + 10 Iron Gear Wheels + 4 Transport Belts
- Place labs near your science pack production and connect to power grid
- Labs have 4 input slots for different science pack types

### Automation Science Packs
- Craft: 1 Copper plate + 1 Iron gear wheel → 5 packs (5 seconds)
- Unlocks: Steel smelting, Electric mining drills, Assembling Machine 2, Electric furnaces
- **Priority**: Research this immediately after basic setup

### Logistic Science Packs
- Craft: 1 Inserter + 1 Transport Belt → 5 packs (6 seconds)
- Unlocks: Fast transport belts, Fast inserters, Steel chests, Underground belts, Splitters
- Enables efficient material handling and storage

**Upgrade your factory:**
- **Fast Transport Belts** (30 items/second) - faster item throughput
- **Long-handed Inserters** - reach farther to connect machines
- **Fast Inserters** - grab/place items 2.3x faster
- **Steel Furnaces** (2x faster smelting)
- **Assembling Machine 2** (1.25x faster crafting)
- **Inserter Strategy**: Use long-handed inserters for spacing, fast inserters for high-volume production lines

### Chemical Science Packs
- Craft: 3 Advanced Circuits + 2 Engine Units + 1 Sulfuric Acid → 1 pack (24 seconds)
- Unlocks: Nuclear power, Uranium processing, Advanced oil processing, Electric furnace upgrades
- **Requires oil processing infrastructure**

### Space Science Packs
- **Generated automatically** by successful rocket launches with satellites
- Unlocks: Final technologies and victory
- Requires completed rocket silo and satellite production

## Phase 3: Oil Processing (30-60 minutes)

### Set Up Oil Infrastructure
1. Build **Pumpjack** on oil deposits
2. Build **Oil Refinery** for **Advanced Oil Processing**
3. Build **Chemical Plant** for fluid processing
4. Build **Water Pump** near water for water supply (needed for oil processing AND boiler power)

### Key Products from Oil
- **Plastic Bars** (from petroleum gas + coal)
- **Sulfuric Acid** (enables batteries and processing units)
- **Solid Fuel** (better than coal for power)

### Chemical Science Packs
- Craft: 3 Advanced Circuits + 2 Engine Units + 1 Sulfuric Acid
- Unlocks advanced technologies

## Phase 4: Advanced Materials (60-90 minutes)

### Steel Production
- Convert iron plates to steel in steel furnaces
- Steel enables: Electric Furnaces, Advanced Circuits, Nuclear tech

### Circuit Production
- **Electronic Circuits** → **Advanced Circuits** → **Processing Units**
- Processing Units are needed for rocket components

### Nuclear Infrastructure
- Mine uranium ore
- Build **Centrifuge** for uranium processing
- Build **Nuclear Reactor** for massive power generation

## Phase 5: Rocket Production (90+ minutes)

### Rocket Components
1. **Rocket Fuel** (10 solid fuel → 1 rocket fuel)
2. **Low Density Structure** (steel + copper + plastic)
3. **Rocket Parts** (steel + structures + fuel + circuits)

### Satellite Assembly
- **Satellite** requires:
  - 100 Low Density Structures
  - 100 Solar Panels
  - 100 Accumulators
  - 5 Radars
  - 100 Processing Units
  - 50 Rocket Fuel

### Rocket Silo Construction
- Massive structure requiring 1000 steel plates, 1000 stone bricks, 100 pipes, 200 processing units
- Launches satellites into orbit
- Each launch generates Space Science Packs

## Victory Conditions
- Launch satellites into orbit using the Rocket Silo
- **Space Science Packs** are generated automatically from successful satellite launches (1000 packs per launch)
- Feed space science packs to labs to complete the final research technologies
- Victory is achieved when all required space science research is completed

## Tips for Speed
1. **Research Priority**: Build labs early and keep them constantly supplied - research unlocks everything
2. **Parallel Production**: Set up multiple production lines for key materials
3. **Inserter Mastery**: Always use inserters to automate material flow - they're your factory's "workers"
4. **Belt Optimization**: Use splitters and mergers for efficient item distribution
5. **Inserter Upgrades**: Stack inserters handle multiple items at once, fast inserters for speed
6. **Power Scaling**: Transition from steam to solar/nuclear as you expand
7. **Water Management**: Never forget water pumps - boilers and oil processing both need constant water

## Critical Path Summary
**Basic Mining** → **Labs + Automation Science** → **Inserters/Belts** → **Logistic Science** → **Oil Processing** → **Chemical Science** → **Nuclear + Advanced Materials** → **Rocket Silo** → **Space Science (Victory)**

**Research unlocks everything - build labs immediately after basic power!**
