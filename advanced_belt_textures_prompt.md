# Advanced Belt Textures for Gemini Nano Banana

Generate pixel art textures for FactoryForge's advanced belt mechanics. Each texture should be 32x32 pixels, clean pixel art style matching Factorio's industrial aesthetic.

## Underground Belt Texture

**Filename:** `underground_belt.png`
**Size:** 32x32 pixels
**Style:** Clean pixel art, industrial/factory theme

**Description:**
Create a simple underground belt texture showing the surface entry/exit points. The texture should show:
- A small circular or square portal/hole in the center
- Dark metallic rim around the edge (dark gray, #404040)
- Subtle grid pattern inside the portal (representing underground tunnel)
- Very minimal design since most of the belt is invisible underground
- Industrial aesthetic with slight wear/rust details
- Central focus area should be about 16x16 pixels for the portal itself

**Color Palette:**
- Portal interior: Dark metallic (#303030)
- Portal rim: Slightly lighter metal (#505050)
- Grid lines: Very dark gray (#202020)
- Background: Transparent

**Key Elements:**
- Circular portal design
- Industrial metal texture
- Minimal but recognizable as an entry point
- Should look like a manhole or access hatch

## Splitter Texture

**Filename:** `splitter.png`
**Size:** 32x32 pixels
**Style:** Clean pixel art, industrial/factory theme, brown/beige coloring

**Description:**
Create a splitter texture showing a central distribution hub with multiple output arms. The design should show:
- Central square hub (about 12x12 pixels) with metallic brown coloring
- Four arms extending from the center in cardinal directions (north, east, south, west)
- Each arm should be 4-5 pixels wide and extend 6-7 pixels from center
- Arms should have conveyor belt appearance with subtle motion lines
- Central hub should have electronic/control panel details
- Industrial brown/beige color scheme (#8B4513 to #D2B48C range)
- Small indicator lights or control panels on the hub

**Color Palette:**
- Central hub: Medium brown (#8B4513)
- Arms: Lighter brown (#D2B48C)
- Control panels: Dark brown (#654321)
- Indicator lights: Red/Yellow dots (#FF0000, #FFFF00)
- Metallic accents: Copper tone (#B87333)

**Key Elements:**
- Central square hub
- Four extending arms
- Brown industrial coloring
- Electronic control details
- Conveyor belt arm appearance

## Merger Texture

**Filename:** `merger.png`
**Size:** 32x32 pixels
**Style:** Clean pixel art, industrial/factory theme, green accent coloring

**Description:**
Create a merger texture showing a central collection hub with multiple input arms. Similar to splitter but with distinct visual differences:
- Central square hub (about 12x12 pixels) with metallic green tint
- Four arms extending from the center in cardinal directions (north, east, south, west)
- Arms should be slightly wider than splitter arms (5-6 pixels wide)
- Each arm should extend 6-7 pixels from center
- Arms should have conveyor belt appearance with subtle motion lines
- Central hub should have electronic/control panel details
- Green industrial color scheme (#556B2F to #9ACD32 range)
- More pronounced indicator lights or control panels on the hub
- Slightly different hub shape or additional details to distinguish from splitter

**Color Palette:**
- Central hub: Medium green (#556B2F)
- Arms: Lighter green (#9ACD32)
- Control panels: Dark green (#2F4F2F)
- Indicator lights: Green/Yellow dots (#00FF00, #FFFF00)
- Metallic accents: Brass tone (#B5A642)

**Key Elements:**
- Central square hub (slightly different from splitter)
- Four extending arms (wider than splitter)
- Green industrial coloring
- Electronic control details
- Conveyor belt arm appearance
- Visual distinction from splitter (shape, lights, accents)

## Generation Instructions

**For Gemini Nano Banana:**
- Generate each texture at exactly 32x32 pixels
- Use pixel art style with clean lines and no anti-aliasing
- Match Factorio's industrial aesthetic
- Ensure textures work well at small scale
- Use appropriate color palettes for each belt type
- Focus on functionality and recognition over decorative elements
- Keep designs simple but distinctive

**Technical Requirements:**
- PNG format with transparency
- Pixel perfect alignment
- Industrial/factory theme consistency
- Should integrate well with existing FactoryForge belt textures
- Color schemes should distinguish different belt types clearly

**Reference Style:**
Look at existing Factorio belt textures for reference - clean, functional, industrial design with appropriate coloring for different purposes.
